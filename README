     this module was developed for my project on which working for CESNET

			        vist us at 
                      http://www.cesnet.cz/english/ 


myPerlLDAP is set of classes for work with LDAP databases. Main diference
to other modules like Net::LDAP, Mozilla::perlLDAP and Mozilla::perlOpenLDAP
is that it is strictly OO, you can work with it only, trought set of classes.

It depends on Mozilla::perlOpenLDAP, it is using some pieces of code from
Mozilla:perlLDAP fror more info look at LEGAL file.

Instalation
~~~~~~~~~~~
Instalation of the myPerlLDAP is separated into two steps

Step 1:
	tar zxvf myPerlLDAP-<version>.tar.gz
	cd myPerlLDAP-<version>
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	su -c "make install"

	Now you have installed basic part - by hand written classes - the core.

Step 2:
