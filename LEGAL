This module is based on pieces code from Mozilla::perLDAP I used parts from it
as described latter:

  Mozilla::perLDAP::conn - heavy modified some functions were deleted, some
      moved, others changed. Before each function is short notice informing
      what I did to it.

  Mozilla::perLDAP::entry - I wrote my own Entry from scratch

  Mozilla::perLDAP::utils - I grabed from it *only* function which are needed
      for myPerlLDAP::conn work. Again before function's code is notice about
      it's source.
